Other spells cast with evothaum have a duration determined on a case-by-case basis by the GM. %0a%0aNote that thaumaturgical attacks (and therefore evothaum attacks of this nature) have no weapon rating, and the "to strike" value is the Power of the spell, not your Control roll. %0a%0a''However'', possessing evothaum and channeling/evocation allows you to cast evocation spells with thaumaturgical narrative. That means that on top of being able to cast spells with thaumaturgy effects (using thaumaturgy mechanics for determining the Power needed for the spell) with an evocation, you can also cast spells with thaumaturgy-level narrative that follow evocation rules. This doesn't provide you with any special abilities, but expands the possible narrative options you have with your thaumaturgy.%0a%0aOne interesting use of evothaum is taking advantage of the ability to string together more than one aspect into a single thaumaturgical spell.
