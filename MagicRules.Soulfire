You may take a hit to this stress track to boost the power of a spell by that many shifts (this cannot replace a mental stress hit for calling up power, but is used to "reinforce" the spell with additional power). You may also use this stress track to absorb Backlash; remember, you may only use one stress track at a time to absorb a spell's Backlash. You may use this track to reinforce spells via Power or absorbing Backlash or both; in any case, you receive all of the applicable benefits listed above.%0a%0a•  Wizard's Constitution and normal Healing/Recovery rules don't apply to clearing Soulfire stress/consequences. You have to spend a scene doing something to justify starting your recovery, which needs to be something life-affirming, like serious relaxation, engaging with loved ones, pursuing something creative, etc. This must take place IC with another PC (with a summary and transcript of the scene posted on your Character Thread) or during a GM-run scene as approved by a GM. Stress goes away after you justify recovery. The consequences begin recovering as per the default rules.%0a%0a•  A clarification is in order: Soulfire isn't Sponsored Magic in regards to the other Sponsored Magic rules. It's been reevaluated in PP and by staff as a separate, distinct form of magical upgrade, and follows it's own rules outlined in this post.
