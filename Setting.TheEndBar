There are only two distinguishing features of the building it's in. In true old fashioned tavern style, there are no words on it. It's just a shaped sign of a horse with a flowing mane, chugging a frothy pint of beer. The doors are the second feature, though they're less obvious. They are extremely large and very heavy double doors made of oak-faced steel. Only their well-oiled hinges and clever engineering make them easy to open. %0a%0aThe interior is dimly lit by, of all things, glowing mushrooms encased in cast iron cages of a piece, with no door or mechanisms. These cages are ensconced in niches high up on the walls, as well as  dangling from short, heavy steel chains on the ceiling. The ceiling itself is all over brick, the walls sloping up into an arched ceiling. %0aScattered throughout the common area are mismatched tables and chairs, the only rule being that they're all roughly of a size with each other. Along both side walls are three traditional pub booths, though none of the U-shaped monstrosities popular in some places. %0a%0aFinally, the bar itself: stretching 2/3 of the way across the back of the common area, it's a true old fashioned beauty:  old oak, well maintained and polished. No actual brass bar here,  of course. In true Irish tradition, there are stools along the oaken counter. Beyond, the entire wall is covered in shelving, which is itself well-stocked with every sort of traditional hard liquor (no Malibu here), and there are some thirty beers on tap, ranging from saisons to porters to imperial stouts that will curl a drinker's chest hair, or cause some to grow, as the case may be.%0a%0a!!!Notable Events%0a
