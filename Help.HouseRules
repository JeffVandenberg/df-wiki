text=(:notitle:)%0ahttp://ragnarok.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/images/ragny_houserules.png%0aThe following cover the various house rules, interpretations, and clarifications for the game (other than house rules for magic, covered [[MagicRules|over here]]):%0a%0a*[[#CC|Character Creation]]%0a*[[#MILE|Milestones and Recovery]]%0a*[[#GEN|General House Rules]]%0a%0a----%0a%0a[[#CC]]%0a!!Character Creation%0a%0a!!!Concepts, Templates, and Powers%0a%0a•  All Templates in Your Story are allowed.%0a%0a•  Scions are allowed.%0a%0a•  Custom Templates are allowed with GM approval. Templates are considered a guideline, anyway, and ultimately Aspects (particularly High Concepts) and their corresponding backstory determine the Powers available to a PC.%0a%0a•  Currently, no more Warden PCs are being allowed.%0a%0a•  Due to the game format, being a Knight of one of the Winter or Summer Faerie Queens is not allowed. Instead, in our game, any of the high Sidhe are capable of investing their energy into a Knight’s Mantle, meaning there can be multiple Winter Knights, Summer Knights, Knights of Avalon, etc. You must define who your Sidhe sponsor is and what their agenda is when creating a Knight. %0a%0a•  Similarly, possessing one of the Swords of the Cross is not allowed, but Champions of God may possess other holy Items of Power that mimic the powers the Swords of the Cross possess.%0a%0a•  Likewise, PCs may not play Denarians/possess a Coin from day-to-day, though they may be one of the so-called ‘Cointouched’ and have a Shadow riding with them, or be influenced by the Fallen in other ways.%0a%0a•  PCs with Lawbreaking in their backgrounds are allowed provided they have a reason not to be currently chased by the Wardens. Active warlocks that continue to break the Laws of Magic during play will quickly find themselves hard-pressed by the Wardens and/or other PCs--this unfairly diverts play and resources and is heavily frowned upon. (Note: there are grey areas of the Laws that are easier to work with in the game. If you are planning on “grey” magic, work with a GM to make sure everyone agrees on where the line is.)%0a%0a•  PC concepts must have Free Will--Red Court Vampires, Fae, spirits, etc are off the table because they have no Free Will in the Dresdenverse. %0a%0a•  Players are allowed to play 2 PCs each but are in no way obligated to do so. We recommend waiting a little while to create a second PC until you have gotten some play in with your first. %0a%0a•  Sometimes a character doesn’t work out in play the way it looked on paper.  Within the first few weeks after character creation, you may speak with a GM about rearranging your character’s stats or making minor changes to their backstory.  Only one such rewrite is allowed per character.%0a%0a•  Except to fill both of your PC slots, you may not desanction a PC and submit a new one for approval more than once every three months. Exceptions like PC death, significant upheaval for an existing PCs, etc will be considered and approved on a case by case basis.%0a%0a%0a•  Under rare circumstances, it may make sense for your character to lose access to some powers and gain others during play.  This usually involves some major upheaval in the character’s life, such as taking an Extreme Consequence.  If it is narratively appropriate, you may speak with a GM about rearranging your character’s Powers.%0a%0a•  From the beginning of Dominium Fuego, we've tried to distance ourselves from other chat environments in terms of Player Versus Player conflict. We prefer that characters work together, even if its beleaguered. This means that we should rarely, if ever, have a faction or plot that leads to conflict of a large scale between PCs due to a desire for secrecy, power, et cetera. Anti-heroes, or interesting concepts are good, but please remember, if your character "CAN'T EVER GET ALONG WITH" x-y-z character template, history, etc., it probably doesn't belong here. While arguments will happen, thoughts of all-out assault or similar methods, should not be considered.%0a%0a%0a!!!Powers%0a%0a•  Custom Powers can be submitted for approval via PM to a staff member or by posting it on one of your Character Threads. Custom Powers must be approved by the staff, and all custom powers are available to any player who has the narrative reason and the desire to take them.%0a%0a•  [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1125|Incite Effect]] is a modular power that can be used to design many different kinds of abilities; for instance, it can be used to replace Breath Weapon, Claws, Glamours, and Incite Emotion.%0a%0a•  Currently approved custom powers can be found by going to the [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/powers|Powers database]] and sorting the “Is Official” column so that the powers marked “No” are at the top.%0a%0a•  To clarify, this is the breakdown of skills that can be raised with Skill Shuffle from Beast Change and related powers%0a%0a•  •  Allowed: Athletics, Awareness, Fight, Physique, Stealth%0a%0a•  •  Possible: Guns, Intimidation%0a%0a•  •  Disallowed: Burglary, Contacts, Conviction, Craftsmanship, Deceit, Discipline Driving, Empathy, Lore, Performance, Rapport, Resources, Scholarship, Survival%0a%0a•  Some of the book Powers have been modified or have minimum Refresh requirements attached to them. A list of these changes can be found [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1132|here]].%0a%0a•  Common Catch values can be found [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1343|here]] for reference. We have changed some of the book’s values. Occasionally one of these list Catches may be different for a specific PC (generally when their backstory makes a Catch harder or easier to research than typical).%0a%0a•  True Shapeshifting/Modular Abilities: When taking THE CATCH as a True Shapeshifter or someone with Modular Abilities (or both), you must pick one specific catch for your shifter based on your backstory. Changelings will always have Iron as a Catch. A Demon might always have Holy. A Druidic Shifter might always have Holy Yew, but everytime they shapeshift into something, it must be the same. This also means you cannont change into something made out of your catch.%0a%0a!!!Starting Refresh and Aspects%0a%0a•  Characters start at a Submerged power level: 11 Refresh, 40 skill points, and a Superb (+5) skill cap.%0a%0a•  The Phase 4 & 5 Guest Star aspects are not required for sanctioning. You may choose to leave these aspects blank for now and fill them in during play.%0a%0a!!!Skill Modifications%0a%0a*Rapport + Presence = '''Rapport'''%0a*Endurance + Might =''' Physique'''%0a*Fists + Weapons = '''Fight'''%0a*Alertness + Investigation = '''Awareness'''%0a%0a•  The consolidated skills have all the trappings of both skills that were merged into them. For example, PHYSIQUE is used for Breaking Things, Lifting Things, determining your capacity for physical stress, and all other trappings of Might and Endurance both.%0a%0a•  Craftsmanship, Performance, and Scholarship skills each come with a number of "fields of study" equal to your level of skill. So someone with Fair (+2) Craftsmanship might be particularly skilled with woodworking and sewing, or someone with Good (+3) Scholarship may have a deeper education in Electrical, Mechanical, and Chemical engineering than other subjects. For Scholarship, these fields of study are considered in addition to the languages you speak. These fields of study do not limit all knowledge to these fields, but rather they represent areas you have particular training in.%0a%0a----%0a%0a[[#MILE]]%0a!!Milestones and Recovery%0a%0a•  Minor Milestones and Refreshes occur every two weeks, on Saturday.%0a%0a•  Significant Milestones occur on the first of every month.%0a%0a•  Major Milestones occur after an equinox/solstice.%0a%0a•  All Consequences require some kind of justification to begin recovery unless a power otherwise modifies this (like Wizard’s Constitution or Recovery).%0a%0a•  Mild Consequences recover in 4 hours.%0aModerate Consequences recover in 5 days.%0aSevere Consequences recover in 3 weeks.%0a%0a•  Healing rules and clarifications can be found [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1122|here]].%0a%0a----%0a%0a[[#GEN]]%0a!!General House Rules%0a%0a!!!Weapons and Armor%0a%0a•  Mundane Armor for PCs is capped at Armor: 2 for now, except in very special circumstances. The availability of Armor: 3 may change as the game progresses. %0a%0a•  Mundane Weapons for PCs are capped at Weapon: 3, except in very special circumstances. The availability of Weapon:4+ weapons may change as the game progresses. Two exceptions to this are grenades, which typically are zone-wide attacks valued at Weapon: 4, or using a car as a weapon (typically Weapon: 4).%0a%0a•  You can increase an Item of Power’s normal weapon damage by +2 stress by including Incite Limited Potent Effect: Sharp, or Massive, or some other narratively appropriate modifier, on the IoP for -1 refresh. This boost to stress cannot be upgraded further.%0a%0a!!!Miscellaneous Rules%0a%0a•  We use the optional Escalation rules for Compels, where a GM may escalate a particularly important compel by offering a second or even third Fate Point against the same Aspect. This is not the same as compelling multiple aspects at once; an Escalated compel must be accepted in full or paid off in full (with the same amount of FPs paid to the GM as offered by the Escalated Compel).%0a%0a•  We use a special set of rules for group-PC preparation mechanics, found [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1225|here]]. It is not necessary that you memorize them, but it is good to familiarize yourself before they show up in the middle of a scene.%0a%0a•  We use several optional DFRPG rules: Overflow, Success at a Cost, and Success with Style. The rules for these can be found [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1336|here]].%0a%0a•  Any time you might be capable of making a Spray Attack, you can instead opt to perform a “Spray Maneuver.” A discussion on the mechanics and explanation behind this is located [[link|here]].%0a%0a•  Strength powers increase the distance you can throw objects by one zone per level of Strength you have.%0a%0a•  There seems to be confusion on the mechanics for setting up and carrying out an ambush, a step by step guide is found [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1467#p10062|here]].%0a%0a•  You may take as many ''different'' Supplemental actions on your turn as you like, for a cumulative -1 on your roll, but you may not take so many that you reduce your overall skill roll below -1. (For example, you might move a zone and pick something up for a total -2 on your main action. You could use any skill you possess at Average (+1) or higher, but a Mediocre skill would be rolled at an equivalent -2; this is not allowed.)%0a%0a!!!Clarifications%0a%0a•  You may be able to access Sponsor Debt without needing Sponsored Magic, provided you have a [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/powers/view/134|Sponsored Agenda]].%0a%0a•  Using Lasting Effects like “fire” or “ice,” etc, in conjunction with a weapon doesn’t stack the Incite Effect damage with the item’s damage--you pick one or the other on a successful strike, whichever is more advantageous to the attacker.

Templates are considered a guideline, anyway, and ultimately Aspects (particularly High Concepts) and their corresponding backstory determine the Powers available to a PC.%0a%3c *Due to the game format, being a Knight of one of the Winter or Summer Faerie Queens is not allowed. Instead, in our game, any of the high Sidhe are capable of investing their energy into a Knight’s Mantle, meaning there can be multiple Winter Knights, Summer Knights, Knights of Avalon, etc. You must define who your Sidhe sponsor is and what their agenda is when creating a Knight. %0a%3c *Similarly, possessing one of the Swords of the Cross is not allowed, but Champions of God may possess other holy Items of Power that mimic the powers the Swords of the Cross possess.%0a%3c *Likewise, PCs may not play Denarians/possess a Coin from day-to-day, though they may be one of the so-called ‘Cointouched’ and have a Shadow riding with them, or be influenced by the Fallen in other ways.%0a%3c *PCs with Lawbreaking in their backgrounds are allowed provided they have a reason not to be currently chased by the Wardens. Active warlocks that continue to break the Laws of Magic during play will quickly find themselves hard-pressed by the Wardens and/or other PCs--this unfairly diverts play and resources and is heavily frowned upon. (Note: there are grey areas of the Laws that are easier to work with in the game. If you are planning on “grey” magic, work with a GM to make sure everyone agrees on where the line is.)%0a%3c *Players are allowed to play 2 PCs each but are in no way obligated to do so. We recommend waiting a little while to create a second PC until you have gotten some play in with your first. %0a%3c *Sometimes a character doesn’t work out in play the way it looked on paper.  Within the first few weeks after character creation, you may speak with a GM about rearranging your character’s stats or making minor changes to their backstory.  Only one such rewrite is allowed per character.%0a%3c *Under rare circumstances, it may make sense for your character to lose access to some powers and gain others during play.  This usually involves some major upheaval in the character’s life, such as taking an Extreme Consequence.  If it is narratively appropriate, you may speak with a GM about rearranging your character’s Powers.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Powers%0a%3c %0a%3c *Custom Powers can be submitted for approval via PM to a staff member or by posting it on one of your Character Threads. Custom Powers must be approved by the staff, and all custom powers are available to any player who has the narrative reason and the desire to take them.%0a%3c *[[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1125|Incite Effect]] is a modular power that can be used to design many different kinds of abilities; for instance, it can be used to replace Breath Weapon, Claws, Glamours, and Incite Emotion.%0a%3c *Currently approved custom powers can be found by going to the [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/powers|Powers database]] and sorting the “Is Official” column so that the powers marked “No” are at the top.%0a%3c *Some of the book Powers have been modified or have minimum Refresh requirements attached to them. A list of these changes can be found [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1132|here]].%0a%3c *Common Catch values can be found [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1343|here]] for reference. We have changed some of the book’s values. Occasionally one of these list Catches may be different for a specific PC (generally when their backstory makes a Catch harder or easier to research than typical).%0a%3c %0a---%0a> *[[http://ragnarok.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=659#p4459 | Jade Court Vampires]] are allowed.

The availability of Weapon:4+ weapons may change as the game progresses. Two exceptions to this are grenades, which typically are zone-wide attacks valued at Weapon: 4, or using a car as a weapon (typically Weapon: 4).%0a%3c *You can increase an Item of Power’s normal weapon damage by +2 stress by including Incite Limited Potent Effect: Sharp, or Massive, or some other narratively appropriate modifier, on the IoP for -1 refresh. This boost to stress cannot be upgraded further.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Miscellaneous Rules%0a%3c * We use the optional Escalation rules for Compels, where a GM may escalate a particularly important compel by offering a second or even third Fate Point against the same Aspect. This is not the same as compelling multiple aspects at once; an Escalated compel must be accepted in full or paid off in full (with the same amount of FPs paid to the GM as offered by the Escalated Compel).%0a%3c *We use a special set of rules for group-PC preparation mechanics, found [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1225|here]]. It is not necessary that you memorize them, but it is good to familiarize yourself before they show up in the middle of a scene.%0a%3c *We use several optional DFRPG rules: Overflow, Success at a Cost, and Success with Style. The rules for these can be found [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=1336|here]].%0a%3c *Any time you might be capable of making a Spray Attack, you can instead opt to perform a “Spray Maneuver.” A discussion on the mechanics and explanation behind this is located [[link|here]].%0a%3c * Strength powers increase the distance you can throw objects by one zone per level of Strength you have.%0a%3c %0a%3c !!!Clarifications%0a%3c *You may be able to access Sponsor Debt without needing Sponsored Magic, provided you have a [[http://df.gamingsandbox.com/powers/view/134|Sponsored Agenda]].%0a%3c *Using Lasting Effects like “fire” or “ice,” etc, in conjunction with a weapon doesn’t stack the Incite Effect damage with the item’s damage--you pick one or the other on a successful strike, whichever is more advantageous to the attacker.  %0a%3c *You may take as many different types of supplemental actions as you like during a Full Action for a cumulative -1 on your roll. You cannot reduce your effective roll to below Mediocre (+0) this way. To be clear, different “types” of supplemental actions include (but are not limited to) clearing a Mild Physical Consequence with Recovery, moving a zone, picking something up, drawing or reloading a weapon, etc. %0a%3c *Declarations can be made as a free action at any time, but they do not come with a free tag on them unless a Fate Point was spent to create them.

You may use maneuvers/declarations/other aspects for your magic, if it makes sense. You can't use the Scene's [Dank and Wet] aspect to make a firebomb, for example, or use your [Enraged] emotion to stay hidden. You may even tag or invoke an appropriate aspect for effect to cast “free” 1-stress spells without taking Mental Stress (which may be boosted further with other tags/invokes as appropriate; Rotes cannot be cast when covering Mental Stress this way).%0a> %0a> * Official Summoning rules can be found [[http://ragnarok.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=847|here]].%0a> %0a> * Official Shapeshifting rules can be found [[http://ragnarok.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=848|here]].%0a> %0a> * We use the Soulfire rules found in the Paranet Papers, with some clarifications, found [[http://ragnarok.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1190|here]].%0a> %0a> * Evocation Blocks and Counterspells have some modifications/specifications that can be found [[http://ragnarok.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=948|here]] and [[http://ragnarok.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=990|here]].%0a> %0a> %0a> Thaumaturgy, Evothaum, and Enchanted Items/Potions containing Thaumaturgic spells may be used to string more than one aspect together into one maneuver. Each aspect's strength must be appropriately powerful and is considered separate from the others, so if you cast a spell at a target that had one aspect at 3, another at 4, and another at 5, and the target rolls the 4 to defend you have a failure, a "fragile," and one based on the power for duration. You may also "spray" these aspects at multiple targets.%0a> %0a> * In the above paragraph, "fragile" is in quotes because magical maneuvers are not fragile; all are considered sticky and last until their duration ends.%0a> %0a> * Invokes/compels used to boost potion strength cannot boost a potion beyond a casting strength of twice your Lore, much in the same way an Enchanted Item's maximum strength is twice your Lore.%0a> %0a> !!!Public Tab%0a> %0a> You'll notice that your character sheet has a tab labeled "Public." This tab is for displaying any information you want everyone to know about your character, such as a character picture and any aspects you want to be public knowledge. You can use this tab instead of a character wiki page for sharing any information about your character you want other players to know.%0a> %0a> !!!Resources%0a> %0a> The City Sheets, with our Threats, Themes, Locations, and Faces can be found [[http://ragnarok.gamingsandbox.com/wiki/Setting/Locations|here]].%0a> %0a> Looking for Guest Stars? Try the [[http://ragnarok.gamingsandbox.com/characters/cast|Cast List]] or this [[http://ragnarok.gamingsandbox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=17|forum thread]].%0a> %0a> !!!Character Creation Advice%0a> %0a> Make your character proactive. A proactive character investigates strange happenings, helps people in trouble, and otherwise goes out and does things that create story. A good part of the game comes from interacting with other PCs, so give your character reasons to go out and interact with others! The less work it takes to get your character involved, the more fun you'll have.%0a> %0a> Your character is part of a large ensemble cast. This doesn't mean your character won't get a chance to shine, but it does mean you'll need to be comfortable with giving other characters time in the spotlight. Think of it as the difference between Iron Man and The Avengers. The Avengers isn't focused on Tony Stark the way Iron Man is - sometimes he isn't on the screen at all - but he still gets to have some amazing heroic moments. So does the Hulk. So does Thor. So does Black Widow. You get the idea. The Avengers is about the team, not just a single member.%0a> %0a> Give your character's aspects clear phrasing. Due to the nature of chat games, your GMs won't always have time to read through the history of every character in their scenes. Your character's aspects should speak for themselves. If no one understands what they mean or what they say, they won't get used that often. Say what you mean so it's clear to someone who is just reading the aspect itself. You can be creative and poetic, but don't be too metaphoric or you'll confuse people.%0a> %0a> Create a character that's fun and engaging to play, even when there's nothing dramatic going on. Ragnarok NYC is always on, which means the game is still running even when all the GMs are offline. Think about what your character does when there isn't anything supernatural happening, and make sure you'll still have fun roleplaying those moments. You'll get the most out of the game if your character is enjoyable to play even without GM intervention.%0a> %0a> [[#RPT]]%0a> !!Tips on Role Playing%0a> %0a> Improv advice often also makes for great roleplaying advice. Here's a good improv [[http://www.dangoldstein.com/howtoimprovise.html|advice article]]. Note that not everything in it applies to roleplaying (e.g. everyone in our game already has a character, so you can't establish details about other player characters), but it's definitely worth a read.%0a> %0a> (:pagelist group=Help list=all:)%0a> %0a> Questions?
