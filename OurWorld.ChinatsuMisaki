She is the main contact for the Summer Court in DC. She is about 5 feet tall and rumored to be a potent user of Summer Magic. She came to the DC area in 1960 along with a donation of several ancient bonsai trees from Japan. A few in her collection are trees that she has personally tended every day for over 500 years, and any interference with these trees will bring about a swift end to the perpetrator. Her outward appearance is that of a short, wizened Japanese woman, but this is concealing her true features - ram horns, goat-like features, and yellow eyes. Chinatsu is often seen in the company of her heterochromatic cat, Kiko.%0a%0a!!!Public Relationships%0a
