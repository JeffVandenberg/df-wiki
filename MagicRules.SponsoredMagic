Part of the cost of Sponsored Magic takes into account the limitations of needing your Sponsor's approval and having to deal with a Sponsor in general, but we do not feel that is worth an effective +2 Refresh rebate; we are in effect changing that implied rebate to just +1 Refresh, bringing the base cost for Sponsored Magic to -5. %0a%0a"With rare exception" means that more-limited sponsored magic powers may qualify for a discount, and more powerful sponsored magics may cost more than -5.%0a%0a'''How does this affect the rebate for having Sponsored Magic combined with Thaumaturgy and/or Evocation?'''%0a•  Normally, having one of these powers would discount the Sponsored Magic by one refresh, reducing the cost from -4 refresh to -3 refresh. %0a•  With our house rule bringing the cost to -5, having one of Thaumaturgy or Evocation now gives you a +2 refresh rebate, bringing the cost to a total -3 for the Sponsored Magic.%0a•  Having the other power (Thaumaturgy and Evocation) gives a +3 rebate, for a total cost of -2 to add a Sponsored Magic.%0a%0aIn other words, the effective costs for adding Sponsored Magic when you also have Thaumaturgy/Evocation remain the same as with the RAW.
